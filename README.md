# Leroy Gerrits

I'm a full-stack web developer working mostly with the Microsoft stack (C#, .NET, SQL Server, Azure) and Angular as my front-end framework of choice, though I originally started programming in PHP in my young teenage years and still work with the LAMP stack from time to time. Minimalistic at heart, I still prefer vanilla JS or even jQuery over the modern front-end frameworks, and when it comes to the back-end side of things a clean architecture and as few as possible dependencies to third-party libraries, components and frameworks are emphasized. 

Formerly a business owner, I now work fulltime as a software developer for the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). I'm married, have 2 kids, live in a fixer-upper which my wife and I've been renovating ourselves and I'm very sporty in my free time (running, OCR, HIIT, crossfit, boxing).
